The sum of the homogenous and non-homogenous solutions is also &#10;called thesolution to the recurrence relation. Find the solution to — 3xn_1 = —6 subject to the initial condition = 2. &#10;There is no one method to finding pn, and so we must 'guess and check'. Suppose pn is a solution to the non-homogenous equation: &#10;Since the non-homogenous part f(n) = —6 is constant, we 'guess' that p.n &#10;The value of C is: &#10;C for some constant: &#10;—6. &#10;Submit part &#10;Your answer is numerically correct.
