alt="A recurrence relation of order k is of the form &#10;where , Ck are constant and f(n) is a function of n. To fully determine the solution, a recurrence relation of order k must also have k initial &#10;conditions. &#10;When k = 1 this is a first order recurrence relation, which we explored in the previous question.
