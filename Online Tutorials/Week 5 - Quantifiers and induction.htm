alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;d) &#10;In view of your answer to c), is Statement 1 in a) above true? &#10;O yes @ no &#10;Submit part &#10;Statement 1 is indeed incorrect. If x &lt; 2x, then a suitable zso &#10;that x &lt; z &lt; 2x is, for example, z x. So for the statement to &#10;be incorrect we need â€¢(x &lt; 2x), that is, x &gt; 2:r, which (by &#10;subtractingx on both sides) holds if and only if 0 &gt; x.
