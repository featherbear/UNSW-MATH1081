alt="Another important relation is called a partial order. We say that a relation is a partial order when it has the three characteristic qualities: &#10;• every value should be less than or equal to itself &#10;• ifa &lt; bandb &lt; athenb = a &#10;• ifa &lt; bandb &lt; cthena &lt; c. &#10;Typically, we take a set together with partial ordering such as &quot;less than or equal to&quot; S, &quot;subset&quot; C or &quot;divides&quot; l. Together, the partial ordering and &#10;set are called a partially ordered set or poset. &#10;Instead of an arrow diagram, we use a Hasse Diagram to visualise a poset. This communicates the relation between elements of the set with as few &#10;edges as possible. &#10;Consider the set &#10;Together with the partial ordering C. "></p>

alt="In 1742, Christian Goldbach wrote in a letter to Leonhard Euler that &#10;Every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes. &#10;This is now called Goldbach's conjecture, and is the oldest and best known unsolved problem in number theory. While the proof has remained elusive, &#10;the conjecture has been computer verified for numbers up to 4 x 1018 &#10;Prove the following weakened version of the Goldbach conjecture: &#10;Every even integer between 12 and 19 is the sum of two primes. &#10;The even integers between 12 and 19 are the numbers 12, 14, 16 and 18. Prove that it is possible to write these numbers as a sum of two primes, by &#10;actually writing them as sum of two primes: &#10;• 12 &#10;• 14 &#10;16 &#10;• 18 &#10;5+7 &#10;11+5 &#10;11+7 "></p>

alt="c) &#10;There exists some numbers which are even, and some numbers which are odd. But all numbers are even or odd. Formally we write this as &#10;e Z, n is even or n is odd. &#10;This is a statement about every possible integer. So we can not consider each integer individually and instead we consider an unspecified n e Z. &#10;There are an infinite number of individual existance proofs to do here, but we can reduce the workload to two possibilities by considering &#10;n (mod 2). &#10;If n &#10;If n &#10;O (mod 2) then Ak e Z such that n = 2k, hence n is even. &#10;1 (mod 2) then Ak e Z such that n 1 + 2k, hence n is odd. &#10;Since these are the only possible values forn (mod 2), every integern is either even or odd. &#10;Submit part &#10;Gap 1 &#10;Your answer is correct.
