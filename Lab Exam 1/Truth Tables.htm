alt="Consider the following quote from Catch-22, a 1961 satirical novel by Joseph Heller. The famous passage below describes how a pilot could only be &#10;excused from flying dangerous missions if they requested an evaluation, in which they were shown to be insane. However, there was a catch &#10;(catch-22): anybody who wanted to get out combat duty isn't crazy. &#10;There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face ofdangers that were real and &#10;immediate was the process Of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no &#10;longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but ifhe were sane he had to &#10;fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to, but if he didn 't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the &#10;absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. (p. 56, ch. 5) &#10;Let E be the proposition &quot;The pilot was excused from flying combat missions&quot;, I be the proposition &quot;the pilot is insane&quot; and R be the proposition &quot;the &#10;pilot requested an evalutaion&quot;. &#10;The following true table might be hepful below.
